# 🧮 Basic Calculator (Python)

A beginner-friendly Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — based on user input.

## 🚀 How it works

The program:

1. Asks the user for two numbers
2. Prompts for an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`)
3. Performs the operation
4. Prints the result to the console

### ✅ Example

   Enter the first number: 10  
   Enter the second number: 5  
   Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): *  
   10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
